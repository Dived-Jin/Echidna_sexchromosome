This pipeline compares the Hi-C strength between the small and super scaffold to confirm the sequences along which chromosome. Include the following script:

CalculateHic.sh
calculate Hi-C strength, Hi-C map visualization, and plot boxplot
	
Usage CalculateHic.sh <abs_path> input_10000_abs.bed proximo_10000_iced.matrix fasta.fai atuo.bed sex.bed checklis.txt

input_10000_abs.bed  and  proximo_10000_iced.matrix generated by Hic-Pro

fasta.fai  generated by by samtools 

atuo.bed and sex.bed include four columns include scaffold_id, start, end, and chromosome_id, such as the following:

SUPER_1	0	100000	chr1
SUPER_2	0	100000	chr2
